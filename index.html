                <p>By Bridget Butler-Sullivan</p>
                <p>Frankenstein has encountered multiple alterations and misinterpretations since its publication. Characters have been created, events get fabricated, and our understanding of Adam consistently gets lost in translation. I present to you a response to the mayhem: a comprehensive overview of the monster Shelley created, and the myths others formed.</p>
